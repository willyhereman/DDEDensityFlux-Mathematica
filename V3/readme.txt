Dear user, 

Instead of downloading all the files in the list, we recommend that you 
download the WinZipped (v. 8.1) file DDEDensityFluxV3.zip, which contains

* DDEDensityFluxV3.m: the source code in Mathematica syntax,

a sample notebook, 

* DDEDensityFluxV3.nb: a notebook with a demo of the program for the 
                       discrete Korteweg-de Vries equation (also called
                       the Kac-van Moerbeke lattice).
         
the various data files, for example,

* d_kdv.m: the data file to run the Kac-van Moerbeke lattice,  
           a DDE corresponding the Korteweg-de Vries equation,

as well as ALL other data files listed in the menu of the program 
(and a few extra ones).

Instructions for using the DDEDensityFluxV3.m program should be obvious 
based on the menu system. Just execute the commands in the notebook.

You need Mathematica v. 5.0 or higher to be able to use the program.

Best wishes,
